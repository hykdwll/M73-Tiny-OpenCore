  ## ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️
  
  **It is NOT recommended to use prebuilt OpenCore configurations. They might not work with the exact hardware of your computer, may have features enabled that you don't want, may be outdated, and are harder to diagnose. This configuration is meant to be used as a guide to help you create your own OpenCore configuration for this ThinkCentre, but it can be used as is, only at your own risk.**

  **If your system does not match these specifications (other than the not-important parts, like the WiFi card), it is not guaranteed that this configuration will work for you. If you are unable to get it working, you can create an issue and I will try to help you to the best of my ability.**

  ## Directions
  
  **Follow the steps below by going to the links and following the directions listed. If a step is labeled with a &#42;, that means it's optional, but extremely recommended. If a step is labeled with &#42;&#42;, that means it's optional and not required.**

  | Step # | Link/Directions |
  | :-: | :-: |
  | 0.5 | [For ThinkCentre M93p users, map your USB ports on Windows using this tool. Make sure to enable "Use Native Classes" in Settings, and use "iMac18,1" as the model identifer.](https://github.com/USBToolBox/tool)
  | 1 | [Creating the USB (Do not move the EFI folder. ProperTree is not needed.)](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/#making-the-installer) |
  | 2 | Move the "EFI" folder from this repository to the "EFI" partition on macOS, to the root of your USB drive on Windows, or to the "OPENCORE" partition on Linux. Make sure to move the whole folder itself, not just the files inside of the folder.
  | 3 | [Modify your BIOS settings according to this document. Skip "VT-d" if you do not see it in your BIOS.](/Resources/Documentation/BIOSSettings.md)
  | 4 | [Installation Process (Skip "Double checking your work". Check "OpenCore Multiboot Guide" if you want to multiboot.)](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installation/installation-process.html#booting-the-opencore-usb)
  | 5 | **(For Ventura Only)** [Use OpenCore Legacy Patcher to get graphics acceleration.](/Resources/Documentation/VenturaOCLP.md)

  ## Updating OpenCore/macOS
  
  ### Updating OpenCore with a newer version of this configuration
  **If you want to update OpenCore with a newer version of this configuration, just download the new EFI folder, mount the EFI partition, and copy the folder to the partition. Note, if you've made any changes to the configuration, make sure to remember them or save them somewhere because any changes made will be overwritten.**

  ### Updating OpenCore/macOS manually
  **If you want to update OpenCore manually, you can follow [this guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/update.html#updating-opencore) (harder to follow, but recommended and tells you how to update macOS), or follow [this guide](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/347035-guide-updating-and-maintaining-opencore-new-method/) (easier to follow, but not recommended.) If you want to update macOS 13 Ventura, follow [this guide here.](/Resources/Documentation/VenturaOCLP.md#before-updating-macos)**

  ## Known Issues
  
  ### OpenCore Legacy Patcher Issues
  **Because of the fact that macOS 13 Ventura does not offically support the hardware featured in this ThinkCentre, we have to use a tool called "OpenCore Legacy Patcher" to apply patches that allow us to use Ventura normally. Sadly, these patches do have some minor issues. To check the issues that affect this ThinkCentre, check [this link](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/issues/1008/) and look for "Haswell" in "Known Issues". As mentioned before, these bugs are quite minor and will not affect most people.**

  ### No VGA Output
  **Due to macOS not offically supporting VGA, you will not be able to output the macOS user interface via the VGA port featured on the ThinkCentre. At the moment, this is currently impossible to fix.**

  ### Monterey 12.3+ crashes during setup on the HD4400
  **With the HD4400, Monterey 12.3 or newer crashes during the "Migration Assistant" part of setup. Sometimes, you can get past the screen, but it'll freeze later. This issue can only be fixed by upgrading your CPU to one with an HD4600 iGPU. It is unknown if this happens in Ventura.**

  ### HD4400 Glitching and Freezing
  **The HD4400 has many issues in macOS. For example, some icons may be missing (image below), some random freezes may happen, icons may get replaced, and possibly more. In newer versions of macOS, this can make the system almost unusable. This is impossible to fix at the moment, and the only thing you can do is upgrade your CPU to one with an HD4600 iGPU.**

  ### No Microphone Jack Input
  **Out of the box, there is no microphone jack input with this configuration. It is possible to get microphone jack input by changing the AppleALC layout ID to 66 using [this guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/audio.html#making-layout-id-more-permanent), but this results in distorted headphone audio. This can be fixed by going to System Preferences -> Sound, and moving the "Balance" slider left or right. Due to the distorted headphone audio, this configuration is not setup for microphone jack input out of the box. The combo jack (labeled as the headphone jack) is not affected by this issue, and works fine out of the box.**
